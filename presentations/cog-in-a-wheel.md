Some thoughts as a software engineer 3 years after graduation

Hi I am Joel! LYLC 18/19 NUS CS, 4 years in B Block, mainly involved in cultural and was 30th JCRC Cultural Director. After graduation at DBS I worked on an effort to consolidate APIs from multiple legacy systems. After which I spent more than a year at Circles.life and worked on backend services in the e-commerce domain. Currently I am at Thoughtworks as a Software Developer Consultant. I am passionate about uncovering better ways we work with software to deliver value and impact. Most fulfilling time of the journey thus far was establishing contact with senior leaders and trying to influence development practices and thought that are wider than individual day-to-day responsibilities.

# Cog in a Wheel

Not a happy metaphor

- Small cog, big wheel
- Good cog, lousy wheel
- Your place in the organisation
- Your impact in the world
- Self-fulfillment
