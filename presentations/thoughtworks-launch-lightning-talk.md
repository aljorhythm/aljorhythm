# Ways Of Working - The Bounds

## Cargo Cult

The term cargo cult as an idiom originally referred to aboriginal religions that grew up in the South Pacific after World War II. The practices of these groups centered on building elaborate mock-ups of airplanes and military landing strips in the hope of summoning the god-like beings who arrived in airplanes that had brought marvelous cargo during the war

## Why does this happen

we are humans
evolution

- look for shortcuts
- communicate what is convenient
- existing mental models
- communication is difficult

happens if not careful

## Agile Cargo Cult

**Also known as**

Agile theatre, faux agile, dark agile

**Different contexts**

- [Cargo Cult Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
- Political idealogies and groups
- Pseudoscience
- Daily life habits, folk practices

**Examples of varying degree**

- Aiming for ever increasing story points
- *Continuous delivery* without automated tests
- Only development team is agile
- Drawing lines on a gantt chart to split into *iterations*

## What I try to do

1. Ask why recursively

- Why automate tests?
    - Why do regression fast?
        - Why have fast feedback loops?
            - Why change fast confidently?
                - Why experiment quickly?
                    - Why find out what works?
                        - Why deliver value?
                            - Business
                            - Revenue
                            - Impact, solve problems

Causes and effects run in many directions. 
Correlation does not imply causation.

- why airplanes and military landing strips?
    - why the gods will come?      <-----     ??????
        - we want food

2. Seek out the bounds
    - What did people at the core / origin say
        - What are they saying about those claiming to be X but are mistaken
        - How have their thoughts evolved
    - The most vibrant arguments over whether B is X

- #NoEstimates
- No QA Teams
- Agile without iterations

3. Be cautious, aware, careful and consistent about how words are used. [No True Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)

4. Be open minded

> I like to say that I may have invented story points, and if I did, I’m sorry now. Let’s explore my current thinking on story points. At least one of us is interested in what I think.

> The point is, the team doing work decides how to do it. That is a fundamental agile principle. That even means if the team doesn't want to work in an agile way, then agile probably isn't appropriate in that context, and [not using agile] is the most agile way they can do things in some kind of strangely twisted world of logic.
