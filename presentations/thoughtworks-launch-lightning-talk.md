Some of the more uncommon things we ought to hear

Cargo Cult

## Why does this happen

we are all humans
evolution

## Agile Cargo Cult

### AKA

Agile theatre, faux agile, 

## What I try to do

1. Ask why recursively

- Why automate tests?
    - Why do regression fast?
        - Why have fast feedback loops?
            - Why change fast confidently?
                - Why experiment quickly?
                    - Why find out what works?
                        - Why deliver value?
                            - Business / Impact

NOTE: Causes and effects run in many directions

2. Seek out the bounds
    - What did people at the core / origin say
        - What do
    - How have their thoughts evolved

3.
