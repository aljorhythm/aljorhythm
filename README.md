## What I do

code, guitar, eat

## Stuff I try to engineer by

1. There are no silver bullets, only trade offs
2. Integrity is the best policy
3. Be reason-able
4. Always get close to original source of ideas, do not cargo cult

## Software

- Make systems easy to reason about
- In a context, assume as little as possible
  - if not encoded, make them explicit if not make them obvious
- Clear is better than clever
- Decouple areas of concerns
- Code is more read than written

## Quotes I live by

‚ÄúYou must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.‚Äù  - Richard Feynman
