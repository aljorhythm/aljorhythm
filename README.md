See my [stack on stackshare.io](https://stackshare.io/aljorhythm)

I like problem solving, thinking critically, asking questions, want to be receptive to change, and am obsessed about improvements. Keen on using technology to make a positive impact at scale. Passionate about and reader of DevOps culture, Agile and software testing. Also interested in social-technical aspects of product development and software engineering.

## What I do

code, guitar, eat

## Stuff I try to engineer by

1. There are no silver bullets, only trade offs
2. Integrity is the best policy
3. Be reason-able
4. Always get close to original source of ideas, do not cargo cult

## Software

- Make systems easy to reason about
- In a context, assume as little as possible
  - if not encoded, make them explicit if not make them obvious
- Clear is better than clever
- Decouple areas of concerns
- Code is more read than written

## Quotes I live by

‚ÄúYou must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.‚Äù  - Richard Feynman
