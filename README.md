## Principles and Practices

1. No Silver Bullet
2. Valuable, meaningful, actionable and quick feedback is paramount

### Software Principles

- Dependency Injection
- Always ensure backwards compatibility - Changes should avoid downtime or coordination between isolated components

### CI/CD

- Avoid works on my machine at all costs
- Slow feedback is better than no feedback
- Fast feedback is better than slow feedback
